# calculator
I set myself the goal of making a calculator in a limited time (two hours). I know that if the result is too big it goes out of the frame, unfortunately the time was coming to an end and I did not have the opportunity to solve the problem

I made all the codes myself, if you want to take them back there is no problem. Have fun !
